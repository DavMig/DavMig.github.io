&lt;p>At work, we are currently deploying GKEs for our applications. Today, containerization is no longer something I see as optional but a necessity due to the value it provides—though it&amp;rsquo;s often necessary to work on team organization first to get the most out of it, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, mastering such a system is not within everyone&amp;rsquo;s reach. Implementing technical governance around this system is no easy task, and those who implement it generally agree—it&amp;rsquo;s complex and requires real expertise to design and deploy the various stacks with technology choices suited to the context.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://davmig.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 17:51:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davmig.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-me">About Me&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m just an IT guy who started my journey with the QNX operating system—long before I ever used Windows. I learned a lot working with QNX, and for those who remember the Photon Desktop Manager, it was truly ahead of its time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, Windows came along, but I quickly transitioned to FreeBSD. I ended up using both systems for quite a while. I spent many years as a sysadmin before moving into project management. Today, I’m a Project Director, which has taken me far from the technical side of things.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
