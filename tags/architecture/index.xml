&lt;p>This project started as a side project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But from the beginning, I made a deliberate choice:&lt;br>
Even as a solo engineer, AI integration would be treated as production infrastructure, not as a feature experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The objective was not to “connect an LLM”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The objective was to design inference as a first-class platform capability inside the product, so that we can easily onboard new functions that will help me with my business needs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
