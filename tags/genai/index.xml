&lt;p>This project started as a side project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But from the beginning, I made a deliberate choice:&lt;br>
Even as a solo engineer, AI integration would be treated as production infrastructure, not as a feature experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The objective was not to “connect an LLM”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The objective was to design inference as a first-class platform capability inside the product, so that we can easily onboard new functions that will help me with my business needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Noise to 100% Reliability: A GenAI Implementation Journal</title><link>https://davmig.github.io/posts/genai-implementation-methodology-tcg/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davmig.github.io/posts/genai-implementation-methodology-tcg/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="objective-architecting-a-high-reliability-genai-pipeline">Objective: Architecting a High-Reliability GenAI Pipeline&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal of this article is to detail the methodology and reasoning behind implementing a generative AI treatment for data extraction from raw pixels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The use case is very concrete: I run a Trading Card Game (TCG) website with about 14,000 monthly visitors. I needed to automate the extraction of data from card illustrations—specifically, the illustrators&amp;rsquo; names, which are not readily available in any database. While my site is small, it serves as my personal &lt;strong>Engineering Laboratory&lt;/strong> for experimenting with &amp;ldquo;Enterprise-grade&amp;rdquo; technology integrations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
